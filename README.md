### ‚öôÔ∏è Optimize Portfolios
Take your portfolio to the next level with **smart optimization**!  
Choose an objective and let the system search for the best possible combination of assets.

**Available optimization objectives:**
- **Sharpe Ratio** ‚Äì maximize risk-adjusted return  
- **Sortino Ratio** ‚Äì focus on downside protection  
- **Calmar Ratio** ‚Äì balance return vs. drawdown  
- **Minimum Volatility** ‚Äì lowest possible risk  
- **Annualized Return** ‚Äì pure performance chasing  
- **Beta** ‚Äì target market sensitivity  
- **Diversification Score** ‚Äì maximize cross-asset independence  

Each optimization run generates **thousands of random portfolios**, evaluates them, and visualizes the results using interactive **Plotly** scatter charts.
